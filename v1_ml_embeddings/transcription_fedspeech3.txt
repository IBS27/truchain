Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. Although some important federal government data have been delayed due to the shutdown, the public and private sector data that have remained available suggest that the outlook for employment and inflation has not changed much since our meeting in September. Conditions in the labor market appear to be gradually cooling, and inflation remains somewhat elevated. In support of our goals and in light of the balance of risks to employment and inflation, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to lower our policy interest rate by a quarter percentage point. We also decided to conclude the reduction of our aggregate securities holdings as of December 1. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Global indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. GDP rose at a 1.6 percent pace in the first half of the year, down from 2.4 percent last year. Data available prior to the shutdown show that growth in economic activity may be on a somewhat firmer trajectory than expected, primarily reflecting stronger consumer spending. Business investment in equipment and intangibles has continued to expand, while activity in the housing sector remains weak. The shutdown of the federal government will weigh on economic activity while it persists, but these effects should reverse after the shutdown ends. In the labor market, the unemployment rate remained relatively low through August. Job gains have slowed significantly since earlier in the year. A good part of the slowing likely reflects a decline in the growth of the labor force due to lower immigration and labor force participation, though labor demand has clearly softened as well. Although official employment data for September are delayed, available evidence suggests that both layoffs and hiring remain low, and that both households' perceptions of job availability and firms' perceptions of hiring difficulty continue to decline. In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen in recent months. Inflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022, but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Estimates based on the Consumer Price Index suggest that total PCE prices rose 2.8 percent over the 12 months ending in September, and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent as well. These readings are higher than earlier in the year, as inflation for goods has picked up. In contrast, disinflation appears to be continuing for services. Near-term measures of inflation expectations have moved up on balance over the course of this year on news about tariffs, as reflected in both market- and survey-based measures. Beyond the next year or two or so, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. At today's meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by a level of investment there or market bubbles? How is the Fed thinking about that? So I don't think that the – you're right, there's a lot of data centers being built and other investments being made around the country and around the world. And big U.S. companies are just investing a lot of resources in thinking about how AI, which will be based on those data centers, run through those data centers, is going to affect their businesses. So it's a big deal. I don't think that the spending that happens to build data centers all over the country is especially interest sensitive. It's based on longer-run – it's, you know, longer-run assessments that this is an area where there's going to be a lot of investment and that it's going to drive higher productivity and that sorts of things. So I don't know how those investments will work out, but I don't think they're particularly interest sensitive compared to some of the other sectors. And then just a quick follow-up, you mentioned that you do have data that you're looking at for inflation and growth in the absence of government data. Could you give us a sense – I think we know a lot about the jobs data that's out there. Can you give us a sense of what you're looking at to track inflation in the absence of government data? Thank you. So it's a lot of things, and it doesn't replace government data. But, you know, you know all of these. You know, it's – I'll just mention some of the many, many names – Price Stats, Adobe, and others. And for wage inflation, there's ADP data. On spending, you're going to ask about spending at some point. You know, there are lots of other things that we look at. But it's – again, it's many, many different sources, and again, including what we get out of the Beige Book, which will be sort of come out mid-cycle, as always. And it doesn't replace the government data, but it gives us a picture. Again, I think if something material were happening, if there were material developments, I think we would pick that up. I don't think we'll be able to have the very granular understanding of the economy while this data is not available. Howard? Howard Schneider with Reuters. Thank you. I just wanted you to elaborate a little bit on what you said a moment ago about the lack – the continued shutdown making it more difficult to make a move in December, and that may make you more cautious. To the degree you are relying on private data that isn't the gold standard, or that you're relying on your own surveys of the Beige Book, do you worry at some point you're going to have to start making policy by anecdote? You know, this is a temporary state of affairs. And, you know, we're going to do our jobs. We're going to collect every scrap of data we can find to evaluate it and think carefully about it. And that's our jobs. That's what we're going to do. If you ask me, could it affect the December meeting, I'm not saying it's going to. But, yeah, you could imagine that, you know, what do you do if you're driving in the fog? You slow down. So that could or could not. I don't know how that's going to play into things. We may get – the data may come back. But there's a possibility that it would make sense to be more cautious about moving. I'm not – I'm not committing to that. I'm just saying it's certainly a possibility that you would say we really can't see, so let's slow down. As a follow-up in the debate in this meeting, we saw recently some pretty big layoff announcements coming from Amazon and others. Wondering if that figured into the discussion at all, that you're starting to see the turn – this tension between growth and employment starting to be resolved, you know, to the detriment of employment. And secondly, some of the stress is starting to appear in the bottom spur of decay, as they call it, household health premiums that are going to be – possibly be going up quite substantially, things like that. Has that started to become a factor in your policy discussion? So those are – those are both things, you know, that we're watching very, very, very carefully. To start with the layoffs, you're right. You see a significant number of companies either announcing that they are not going to be doing much hiring or actually doing layoffs. And much of the time, they're talking about AI and what it can do. So we're watching that very carefully. And, you know, yes, it could absolutely have implications for job creation. We don't really see it in the initial claims data yet. Now, it's not a surprise that we don't. It takes some time for it to get in there, but we're watching that really carefully. But again, don't see it yet in the initial claims data. On the K-shaped economy thing, I would say the same thing or a similar thing. You know, you have to take what comes, and what comes right now is a pretty challenging situation where we have, first of all, we have 4.3% unemployment, we have an economy that's growing close to 2%, so, you know, overall it's a good picture, it's a good picture. But in terms of our policy, we have upside risks to inflation, downside risks to employment, and this is a very difficult thing for a central bank because, you know, one of those calls for rates to be lower, one calls for rates to be higher, we can't do both, so we have to balance the two, and so it's a challenging thing, and, you know, as we have worked our way through this process, you would expect that there would be a range of views across the committee on what to do and the speed with which we should do it, and that's what we have. That makes a lot of sense to me. These are, all of these people are, you know, people who take their jobs very seriously, work very hard at this, and just want to do what's right for the American people, but they have different views on what that is, and, you know, it's an honor to work among people who care that much, it is, but, you know, I don't feel that it's unfair or anything like that, it's just, it's a time when we're making quite difficult judgments in real time, and I believe we'll get through this, and I think we've done sort of the right thing so far this year. I think we were, it was appropriate for us to be careful about this. I think it would not be appropriate to just ignore or assume away the inflation issue. At the same time, I think the risk of higher, more persistent inflation has declined significantly since April, and if we do wind up resuming rate cuts at some point, we will at some point, you know, I think we're trying to get to the end of this cycle with the labor market in a good place, and with inflation, you know, on its way to 2% or at 2%, so that's all we're trying to do, and we're doing it under, you know, quite challenging circumstances, and doing the best we can. We'll go to Jennifer for the last question. Thank you so much, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with Yahoo Finance. Both regional and large banks have taken losses on loans given delinquencies on subprime auto loans. As Morgan's CEO, Jamie Dimon, warned, when you see one cockroach, there may be more likely. I'm curious how the Fed is looking at these loan losses, and if it poses risks to the financial system or the outlook for the economy. Is it a warning sign? So you know, we're, obviously, we watch these things very carefully, credit conditions very carefully. You're right. You've seen rising defaults in subprime credit for some time now, and now you've seen a number of subprime credit, automobile credit institutions having significant losses, and some of those losses are now showing up on the books of banks. You know, we're looking at it carefully. We're paying close attention. I don't see, at this point, a broader credit issue. It doesn't seem to be something that has very broad application across financial institutions, but you know, we're going to be monitoring this quite carefully and making sure that that is the case. And then separately, many of you, yourself, have said that we're in a bifurcated economy right now with high net worth individuals continuing to spend with a lower income pulling back. How much of consumer spending continuing hinges on the stock market remaining strong? In some odd way, does the market help keep the economy buoyant? So there is some relationship there, but remember, the more wealth someone has, the lower an additional dollar of wealth matters. So your marginal propensity to consume declines quite dramatically as you reach levels of stock market wealth. So the stock market, it would affect spending if the stock market went down, but it wouldn't drop sharply unless there were quite a sharp drop in the stock market. People at the lower end of income and wealth have a much higher marginal propensity to consume of an incremental dollar of income or wealth, but they don't have the stock market wealth. So I think it's certainly a factor supporting consumption right now, and you would see it if you saw a material correction in spending, but you shouldn't think that it will dollar for dollar stop consumption because that wouldn't be the case. Thank you.
